## Union Find

An implementation of the union find (_aka disjoint set_) data structure using the weighted union and path compression heuristics to improve performance.

#### Complexity:

- **Space:** _O(N)_ where _N_ is the number of items
- **Time:** _O(N + M log* N)_ where _N_ is the number of items and _M_ is the number of union/find operations
